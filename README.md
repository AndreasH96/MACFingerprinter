![](https://github.com/AndreasH96/MACFingerprinter/blob/master/assets/Logo.JPG | width = 100)


This project is a proof of concept of a candidate thesis written by Karl-Johan Djervbrant and Andreas Häggström. We are two computer science students at Halmstad University. Please keep in mind that this indeed is a proof of concept and NOT developed to be used in a real life environment. 
This software includes a simple GUI allowing for either reading a .pcapng file or capturing Live probe requests within a network.
The thesis is named "A Study on Fingerprinting of Locally Assigned MAC-Addresses" and contains information on how  mobile  devices conduct MAC-Address randomziation and  how one possibly could fingerprint devices regardless.
